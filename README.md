A list of topics and resources to help someone like me prepare for medical 
genetics in grad school

This will be a list of resources that I found, and found useful for getting 
me ready to go back to school.

## Who am I, and who might you be?
I'm someone who got an undergrad degree in computer science 25 years ago, 
with a lot of work experience in and around human genetics, but no 
education in it. I am spending the summer of 2025 getting ready to have my 
first first day of school in three decades.

I am doing a lot of reading and video watching to try to fill in the holes 
in my education, since an upper-level molecular genetics course is a 
prerequisite of many medical genetics graduate programs. I'm creating this 
repo since someone in a similar boat as me may find these resources useful.

## Caveat Lector
I think this stuff is right, but you should really, really confirm it for 
yourself. I got it as right as I know how, but that doesn't mean it is right. 
Additionally, nothing in this should be considered advice from me, my 
supervisor, my program, my faculty, or my university. This will also be 
necessarily incomplete. My work experience has given me some experience with 
portions of medical genetics, which I will cover only very lightly here.

## Caveat Observator
The links I drop to videos were available without a login when I watched them 
and hopefully they remain that way. If you find a broken link, my apologies.

## Table of Topics, and a Suggested Order

### DNA Structure and Function
  1. Double Helix Architecture: Insights into the Watson-Crick model.
  1. Nucleotide Composition: Understanding the building blocks of DNA.
  1. Major and Minor Grooves: Their significance in protein-DNA interactions.
  1. DNA Supercoiling: Impact on gene accessibility and expression.
  1. Replication Origins: Key sequences initiating DNA replication.
  1. Telomeres and Telomerase: Roles in chromosome protection and aging.
  1. Mutations and DNA Damage: Effects on gene function and regulation.
  1. DNA Methylation: Mechanisms and influence on gene silencing.
  1. Cis-Regulatory Elements: Functions of promoters, enhancers, and silencers.
  1. Transcription Factors: Their role in regulating gene expression.
  2. Videos
     1. "DNA Structure and Replication: Crash Course Biology #10" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kK2zwjRV0M
       Overviews of basic phosphate-sugar backbone structure, the process of DNA replication
     3. "Cell Biology | DNA Structure & Organizaion" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6LXyzZn5Ls&list=PLTF9h-T1TcJi_1FdKlH4dbf_3uI4wuT99&index=7
       This is a long video with a lot of parts in it. Covers chromatin,
       histone proteins, a quick overview of histone and methyl group
       epigenetics.

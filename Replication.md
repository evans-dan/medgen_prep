# Replication
A description of how DNA gets copied

1. Helicase finds a "replication fork" and unzips the helix by breaking the weak hydrogen bonds between the complementary bases. This makes the DNA now have a top (or "leading") strand, and a bottom (or "lagging") strand.
3. At the beginning of the split and in the 5' to 3' direction, RNA primase affixes a few complementary bases, using uracil (U) instead of thymine (T).
4. DNA polymerase beigns after RNA primase leaves off.
   1. Note! DNA polymerase only runs in the 5' to 3' direction (the leading strand). 3' to 5' replication (the lagging strand) is done in 1-2 kilobase chunks called "Okazaki fragments", but it's still done by DNA polymerase.
5. A different kind of DNA polymerase goes along the lagging strand and changes the RNA-friendly nucleotides (uracil) into DNA-friendly version (thymine).
6. DNA ligase enzyme zips the neucleotides back up by recreating the hydrogen bonds between the original templated strand, and the newly created partner strand.
7. DNA polymerase can also do a bit of proofreading and change incorrectly paired nucleotides. The error rate for replication mistakes is about 10e-10.

# Replication Starting Points
The "origin of replicaion" sites (aka ORI sites) occur at about 50k places in the human genome. Their sites are influenced by chromatin structure and other DNA activity.

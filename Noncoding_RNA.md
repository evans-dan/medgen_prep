# Noncoding RNA
Only about 2% of the genome is translated into protein. There are many regions of DNA that are transcribed, but never translated to proteins. These regions are "noncoding RNA". This is some of what used to be called "junk DNA", but it plays many roles. There are several types of ncRNA, and they fall into two basic camps.
## Housekeeping ncRNA
### tRNA (transfer RNA)
76-90 nucleotides long. tRNA carries the anticodon (complementary to the mRNA codon) of a specific amino acid. They deliver this amino acid to the to the ribosome, which adds them to the growing peptide chain. There are over 30 different tRNAs in humans.
### rRNA (ribosomal RNA)
Ribosomal RNA is required for translation of RNA to protein. The form the core of the ribosome, and provide structure. Different rRNA types contribute to both structure and function of the ribosome. The genes that code for rRNA are highly conserved.
## Regulatory ncRNA
### snRNA (small nuclear RNA)
About 150 nts long. They function to process premessenger RNA in the nucleus. They are associated with a specific set of proteins, and are involved in splicing.
### snoRNA (small nucleolar RNA)
They guide modificaiton of other RNAs (e.g. methylation) like rRNA, tRNA and snRNA. It contains a 10-20 base antisense that surrounds the area targeted for modification. The majority of these genes are in the introns of genes that encode proteins involved in robosome synthesis or tranlsation. Others are intergenic, ORFs or protein coding genes, and UTR.
### siRNA (small interfering RNA)
20-24 bases in length, siRNA interfers with the expression of genes by degrading mRNA after it's transcribed. It is double-stranded. Since in theory any gene can be knocked down by a designed siRNA, they're a good tool for investigating gene function since you can design a volume knob. You can also activate genes with synthetic siRNAs.
### miRNA (micro RNA)
21-23 bases long, they are involved in gene silencing and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. It can bind to mRNA with the RISC complex, which leads to degreadation of the mRNA. For expression silencing, it ususally binds to the 3' UTR, which keeps the ribosome from cleaving the translated sequence. Can have tissue-specific expression, and can play a role in the determination of cell type of quiescent stem cells. Has also been implicated in being involved in cancer, as many miRNAs are found to be upregulated in tumor cells.
### piRNA (piwi-interacting RNA)
26-31 bases long, piRNAs are the largest class of ncRNAs. piRNAs combine with a protein to make a complex that are involved in epigenetic and post-transcriptional silencing of transposable elements (hello, Barbara McClintock!) as well as regulation of other genetic elements in germline cells. They make a RNA-induced sliencing complex (RISC) and may have some role in epigenetic effects. Much investigation in flys, and biogenesis of them is still not fully understood.
### lncRNA (long noncoding RNA)
Over 200 bases long. The majority of lncRNAs are tissue-specific. The majority of their sequence overlaps sense/antisense transcripts that can include protein coding genes. They seem to have a bias towards two exon transcripts. They are less conserved that protein coding genes. Play a role in gene-specific transcription, general transcription factors, post-transcriptional processing of mRNA, translation regulation, siRNA-directed gene regulation, epigenetic regulation, imprinting, Xist and X chromosome inactivation...tons of stuff.

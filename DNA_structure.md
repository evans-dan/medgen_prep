# DNA Structure
From largest structure to smallest
## Chromosome
This is the structure that houses everything below. In humans, we have 46 chromosomes autosomal pairs numbered 1-22 longest to shortest, and two sex chromsomes, X and Y.
## Chromatin
This is the name of the complex of proteins and DNA. 
## DNA Supercoiling
DNA can form structures based on how loosely or tightly twisted it is.
## Heterochromatin
Tightly packed groups of DNA-wrapped histones. Can be sufficiently tightly wrapped to inhibit gene translation.
## Nucleosome
The basic "packed" DNA unit. DNA is wrapped twice around a histone protein complex ("like thread on a spool"), an octomer of H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 (all of those numbers should be subscripted!). Two of each of these four makes up the octomer.
## DNA
- DNA is a double helix formed of a phosphate and five-carbon sugar backbone, plus a nucleotide.
- A pentose (five carbon sugar) is connected to the phosphate "above" it at its 5' carbon, and at the phosphate "below" at its 3' carbon. If you think of 5' as above and 3' as below, transcription moves "down" the DNA.
- The other side of the DNA runs in the opposite direction.
- The nucleotides are Adenine (A), Cytosine (C), Thymine (T), and Guanine (A). In DNA, they pair up with their opposite strand neighbour as A-T and C-G.

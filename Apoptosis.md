# Apoptosis
Programmed cell death. Greek; *apo-* "away", *-ptosis* "falling".
## Different types of cell death
### Apoptosis
A falling away, like leaves falling off trees in autumn. It's supposed to happen. Cells that undergo apoptosis are broken down, and their parts can be recycled. The cell starts to form "blebs" (seriously, that's what they're called) which are smaller structures that are filled with recycled cell parts. Those are then taken by the body's recycling system (e.g. macrophages) in a process called phagocytosis ("cell eating"). Apoptosis does not trigger an immune response.
### Necrosis
More like a "bursting" of the cell; its innards get scattered around. This can be bad; if there are infectious agents in that cell, they're now floating around intercellularly and could get incorporated into more cells. Necrosis is often a response to damage to a cell. Necrosis triggers an immune response.
### Others
There are other cell death pathways that aren't apoptosis or necrosis; there are just two major ways.
## When apoptosis happens
### Development
- Embryonically, human hands start as paddle-shaped structures.
- Apoptosis is what separates the paddle into fingers. Tadpoles "resorb" their tails via apoptosis.
### Regulation
- Apoptosis regulates the number of cells in people.
  -- Blood cells are constantly being manufactured. If they were never recycled, we'd have way too many blood cells and that's not good.
  -- "Too many cells" is also a feature of tumors. Failed apoptosis or dysregulated apoptotic pathways are implicated in cancer, and are a potential therapeutic target (see the "Intrinsic apoptosis pathway" below for some more detail).
- Elimination of damaged cells
  -- A cell can detect when its DNA is damaged. First, the cell will try to repair the damage. If that doesn't work, it can initiate the *intrinsic apoptisis pathway*.
  -- A damaged cell may also be identified from the outside by the immune system. That cell can be tagged in a way that initiates the *extrinsic apoptosis pathway*.
- Immune system
  -- During B and T cell production, apoptosis eliminates cells that are non-functional.
  -- Also used to destroy overactive immune cells that are attacking the body itself ("autoimmunity").
  -- Regulates T and B cells after an immune response.
## Intrinsic and Extrinsic apoptosis pathways
Apoptosis is begun when there is a lot of a protein called caspase 3 (Cas3) inside the cell. Cas3 initiates the release of both proteases (protein-lysing enzymes) and nucleases (DNA-lysing enzyme), which breaks down the constituents and structure of the cell. Any cell with high levels of Cas3 is about to die.
### Intrinsic
Mitochondria have a family of proteins called Bcl-2; they regulate the mitochondiral outer membrane permeability (MOMP). Bcl-2 proteins fall into both pro- and anti-apoptosis functions. They interact with each other, so when they're in balance, the membrane of the mitochondria stays relatively impermeable. Howver, when the pro-apoptotic proteins are more abundant the MOMP shifts and allows for the transmission of cytochrome C (CytC) from the mitochondria into the endoplasm. When CytC is released, it joins together with proteins called Apaf1 and Caspase 9 (Cas9). These three proteins form the *apoptosome*, which triggers the release of caspase 3 (cas3) which initiates apoptosis.
### Extrinsic
Apoptosis that's initiated from outside the cell. There is a receptor on the cell membrane to which a protein called Fas attaches. That triggers inside the cell the activation of regions called "death domains". The death domains in turn trigger the release of DISC (death-inducing signaling complex), which stimulates the relase of caspase 8 (Cas8), which in turn leads to the release of cas3, which stimulates release of proteases and nucleases, and that's all she wrote.

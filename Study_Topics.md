# Study Topics
A list of topics suggested to me by ChatGPT.

Prompt:
Create a study guide for someone with an undergraduate degree in computer science and work experience in a human genetics lab that will familiarize them with some details on DNA structure, chromatin, and noncoding RNA as it relates to gene regulation. Please include five separate topics and ten main ideas for each of those topics. Please include two links to video tutorials for each of the five topics from publicly available sites like Youtube. The video tutorial links must be currently available, and please print out the URLs for each of the videos next to their formatted links.

(follow up prompt: The two video tutorials for the Integrated Gene Regulation and Experimental Approaches topic did not print. Can you provide them?)

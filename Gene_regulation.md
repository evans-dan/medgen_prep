# Gene Regulation
Ways to change the speed of transcription, or if a gene is transcribed at all.
## Enhancers and Silencers
Modifies the speed of transcription of a gene. When specific transcription factors bind to the enhancer regions, they cause a loop in the DNA to form, which brings the enhancer region very close to the promoter region on the other side of the "loop". The specific transcription factor will interact with the general transcription factor to either stimulate or repress the work of the RNA polymerase.
## Topologically associating domains (TADs)
These are discrete 3D structures within the nucleus where regions of DNA interact more frequently with each other than with regions outside the domain. These domains play a crucial role in gene regulation by facilitating interactions between regulatory elements (like enhancers) and their target genes within the same TAD while limiting interactions across TAD boundaries. In short, they help organize the genome into "work units" to help ensure gene regulation.
## Nuclear lamina
The lamina is a network of proteins that lines the nucleus. It can interact with chromatin and DNA by acting as an "anchor" for specific genomic regions that often leads to gene repression with lamina associated domains (LADs). These domains are also plastic; they can change during various cell cycles like differentiation and development.
## Epigenetic changes
Some non-base changes to DNA can stably passed on, both through cell division, and even be passed to offspring. Epigenetic "marks" like methylated DNA sequences or histone modifications.  These changes can affect whether a gene expresses or not, which can change the amount of the associated protein.
## miRNA
Micro RNA can downregulate both individual genes, and entire gene modules. miRNA sits with the RISC complex on the (usually) 3'UTR of a gene to inhibit the ribosome from cleaving during translation.

### Connection to developmental genetics
There are some protein complexes like Polycomb group (PcG) and Trithorax (Trx) that play a role in maintaining gene expression patterns by regulating chromatin structure and influencing histone modifications. These complexes can be inherited, contributing to the stability of chromatin states. This means that a cell that has differentiated into a specific cell type can "stay" that cell type by having some genes "on" and some genes "off" across division and development.

# Chromosome and Gene Structure
A summary of the structure of chromosomes themselves. The DNA structure file mentions chromosomes, and this is a look at constitutent parts of the chromosome structure itself, as opposed to the secondary and tertiary structures of chromatin.

## Telomeres
- The 3' "ends" of chromosomes. They protect the ends of chromosomes during mitosis, where they get shorter with every division. Telomerase can assist in protecting them.
- They don't replicate when chromatids go through mitosis, so with each cycle they get a little shorter.
- Some of this shortening is counteracted by telomerase, that makes telomeres. Telomerase is a reverse transcription enzyme; it turns RNA back into DNA. Adds TTAGGG to the 3' end of the telmoere.
- Prokaryotic cells have no telmoerase (don't live long enough to need it).
- Too much telomerase activity: cancer!

## Centromeres
- The central connection point for autosomal chromosomes. Some autosomes are "acrocentromeric", meaning the centromere isn't particularly "central", but quite a bit closer to the telomeres.
- Very stable, as they are GC rich: triple hydrogen bonds between GC vs double betwen AT.
  
## Genes
The segments of chromsomes that are transcribed to RNA, and from RNA to protein. roughly speaking, from 5' to 3' the order is:

* Enhancers/silencers
    * Regions that either stimulate or suppress transcription (or the rate of transcription) of the gene
    * 50-1000bp upstream of the start position
* Promotors
    * Signals where transcription begins.
    * About 25bp upstream of transcription start site.
    * Sequence is TATAA (hence it's called the "TATA box")
    * They can specify transcription start sites
    * Transcription with normal promoter and without the influence of regulatory sequences is called "basal transcription".
 * UTRs (untranslated regions)
    * Exist on both the 5' and 3' end of the gene.
    * They are translated to RNA, but are then removed during splicing/processing of mRNA
    * They act to provide stability to newly created RNA
 * Exons
    * The sections of DNA read in three-base codons to make peptides/residues/amino acids
    * Genes can have many exons
    * "Alternative splicing" can result in "missing" translated exons (they get skipped, never making it into RNA)
 * Introns
    * Regions between exons in a gene. They are spliced out during RNA processing
    * usually contain no protein information
    * there are some other types of RNA that are thought to be translated from within introns
 * Start/Stop codons
    * start codon is ATG in DNA, codes for M/Met/methionine
    * stop codons are TAG, TAA, and TGA. No amino acid, that's just the end of the protein

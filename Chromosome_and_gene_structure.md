# Chromosome and Gene Structure
A summary of the structure of chromosomes themselves. The DNA structure file mentions chromosomes, and this is a look at constitutent parts of the chromosome structure itself, as opposed to the secondary and tertiary structures of chromatin.

## Telomeres
- The "ends" of chromosomes. They protect the ends of chromosomes during mitosis, where they get shorter with every division. Telomerase can assist in protecting them.

## Centromeres
- The central connection point for autosomal chromosomes. Some autosomes are "acrocentromeric", meaning the centromere isn't particularly "central", but quite a bit closer to the telomeres.
  
## Genes
- The segments of chromsomes that are transcribed to RNA, and from RNA to protein.

# Chromosome and Gene Structure
A summary of the structure of chromosomes themselves. The DNA structure file mentions chromosomes, and this is a look at constitutent parts of the chromosome structure itself, as opposed to the secondary and tertiary structures of chromatin.

## Telomeres
- The 3' "ends" of chromosomes. They protect the ends of chromosomes during mitosis, where they get shorter with every division. Telomerase can assist in protecting them.
- They don't replicate when chromatids go through mitosis, so with each cycle they get a little shorter.
- Some of this shortening is counteracted by telomerase, that makes telomeres. Telomerase is a reverse transcription enzyme; it turns RNA back into DNA. Adds TTAGGG to the 3' end of the telmoere.
- Prokaryotic cells have no telmoerase (don't live long enough to need it).
- Too much telomerase activity: cancer!

## Centromeres
- The central connection point for autosomal chromosomes. Some autosomes are "acrocentromeric", meaning the centromere isn't particularly "central", but quite a bit closer to the telomeres.
- Very stable, as they are GC rich: triple hydrogen bonds between GC vs double betwen AT.
  
## Genes
- The segments of chromsomes that are transcribed to RNA, and from RNA to protein.
